There are more than 1000 universities in India and these universities are offering thousands of undergraduate, post-Graduate and doctorate courses. The students applying for these universities have to do a lot of comparison for choosing the university/course on the basis of various criteria’s. A PAN India university information bank is required for accessing course details, comparison of courses, facilities and faculty, admission, tracking student mobility, viewing results, evaluation and certification, verification of certificates, joint online courses (MOOCs). This will help both student and faculty communities for self improvement through comparison and emulations. Lack of information is leading to self glorification and inbreeding among University and College student and faculty members.
